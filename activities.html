		<h3>Arts & Crafts</h3>
		<p>Doing mindful guided meditations can greatly improve your mental health. Try Buddhist mediatations, breathwork, muscle relaxation and mantra mediation. All of these methods are great ways to detress and focus on self-care. It can be as simple as typing in a quick 5 minute video and taking a break or being mindful of your surroundings, mental health is about taking time for you.</p>
