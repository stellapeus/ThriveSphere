		<h3>Workouts</h3>
		<h4>Core</h4>
		<p>Some core workouts to strengthen your abs include planks, deadbug, 
		crunches, bird dog, leg raises, mountain climbers, side plank dips, 
		russian twists, and bicycle crunches. All of these workouts can be 
		intensified by including weights or bands, but they can also be easy 
		activities to complete at home</p>

		<h4>Upper Body</h4>
		<p>Upper body includes your chest, shoulders, and arms. Some 
		workouts include bent over row, triceps extension, lateral raise, 
		biceps curl, bench press, dumbbell curl, overhead press, pushups, 
		triceps kickback, dips, dumbbell row, chin ups, and push presses.
		Most of these upper body workouts require some sort of weight or 
		machine, but there are makeshift workouts that one can complete
		on their own.</p>

		<h4>Legs</h4>
		<p>Having strong legs is very important, because legs are what
		allow you to get around. Some examples of leg exercises include
		squats, calf raises, goblet squats, romanian deadlifts, leg presses,
		front barbell squats, split squats, lunges, or glute bridges. These not
		only strengthen your legs, but also your glutes. Simple exercises like
		squats and calf raises are able to be performed without weights or machines,
		but most of these require gym equipment</p>

		<h4>Rehabilitation</h4>
		<p>Rehabilitation is the process of helping someone recover from an injury 
		so that they are able to continue to workout or play the sport that injured 
		them in the future. This typically involves therapies, exercises, and support
		to regain strength, mobility, and independence. Some of the exercises that are
		meant to help injuries can also be general exercises, but adjusted so that the 
		person is able to perform them. These include quadriceps sets, hamstring curls, 
		bridges, wall angels, clamshells, shoulder blade squeezes, ankles circles, and
		bird dog.</p>
